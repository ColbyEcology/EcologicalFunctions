# EcologicalFunctions
Some ecological functions, grouped mathematically and adapted from B. Bolker 2008, Ecological Models and Data in R.

I found myself referencing these from the book so much that I decided to re-create these gems to print and have up in the office.  I plan on modifying them a bit more, and perhaps create an all-out poster-type document with descriptions, comparisons, and relations to other functions.  In the mean time . . .
